Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**References**\\n|details-split|\\n\\n- Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n  Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n  Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n- Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**References**\\n|details-split|\\n\\n- Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n  Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n  Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n- Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n|details-start|\\n**References**\\n|details-split|\\n\\n- Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n  Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n  Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n- Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.
